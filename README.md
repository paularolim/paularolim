# Hi there, I'm Paula Rolim ðŸ‘‹

I'm a hybrid mobile developer with experience in React Native

## Know me

I have 1 and a half years of experience in mobile development with React Native, and I am currently studying native development with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, as well as Swift with SwiftUI.

In my free time, I'm passionate about game development and I'm studying with the Godot engine, which is a popular option for many developers due to its lightweight and open source nature.

Additionally, I'm passionate about software architecture, especially in mobile development, and had the opportunity to expand my knowledge in architecture while working on the team that designed the architecture of an investment broker's app.

I also enjoy backend development and had the opportunity to intern in the area, where I maintained APIs that facilitated communication between banks and fintechs.

I want to make a difference in someone's life through technology <br>
